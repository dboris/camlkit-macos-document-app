## Overview

This is a macOS _Document App_ starter template built with
[Camlkit](https://github.com/dboris/camlkit) in OCaml. The macOS executable
is built entirely in OCaml following a standard dune-based project layout.
The dune project is fully integrated with the Xcode build system. Running
the application from Xcode will rebuild it and launch the executable.
